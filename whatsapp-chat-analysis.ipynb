      "Cooperatives in the country have a grass-root presence and are deeply rooted in regional specialized trade and are characterized by their democratic functioning. The Cooperative movement holds the key for scaling up of rural livelihood opportunities and catapulting rural economic growth. Cooperative details are currently contained in data silos at the district level, under the jurisdiction of Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies (DRCS). Aggregation of the status and health of cooperatives at a national level is not available owing to which the effectiveness of policy initiatives at the center are constrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Cooperatives Data Repository Internship opportunity offered by the Ministry of Cooperation and implemented via AICTE collaboration and technology support invites local students’ participation in addressing this gap in identification of cooperatives across all 766 districts in the country and thereby providing the opportunity to contribute to the welfare of their district & the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Internship is to be implemented in two phases; wherein Phase 1 shall involve local student participation for collecting data pertaining to identification of basic details, kind of activities undertaken and geotagging of all cooperatives within a specific district. Subsequently, Phase 2 of the Internship shall look to engage the participating students in an in-depth study of all active cooperatives within the district, in order to collect details with regards to their functioning including balance sheet and financials with the ultimate aim of identifying potential improvement areas in the functioning of cooperatives in the country.\n",

      "\n",
      "Students from all academic disciplines may be eligible, although diploma, undergraduate or graduate interns from a social science (sociology/economics) or management background may be preferred\n",
      "Trainees should be residents of that area, which gives them knowledge of the area, knowledge of the local language and their transportation cost is also low.\n",
      "Good understanding of working with computer/mobile and basic knowledge of MS Office/Excel\n",
      "Be able to quickly adopt the prescribed data collection procedures, quality standards of data entry and functioning of cooperatives in the country\n",
      "Interns must be self-motivated and ready to commit to uncovering the potential of the cooperative movement\n",

The Cooperative movement holds the key for scaling up of rural livelihood opportunities and catapulting rural economic growth. Cooperative details are currently contained in data silos at the district level, under the jurisdiction of Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies (DRCS). Aggregation of the status and health of cooperatives at a national level is not available owing to which the effectiveness of policy initiatives at the center are constrained.\\n\\nThe National Cooperatives Data Repository Internship opportunity offered by the Ministry of Cooperation and implemented via AICTE collaboration and technology support invites local students’ participation in addressing this gap in identification of cooperatives across all 766 districts in the country and thereby providing the opportunity to contribute to the welfare of their district & the country.\\n\\nThe Internship is to be implemented in two phases; wherein Phase 1 shall involve local student participation for collecting data pertaining to identification of basic details, kind of activities undertaken and geotagging of all cooperatives within a specific district. Subsequently, Phase 2 of the Internship shall look to engage the participating students in an in-depth study of all active cooperatives within the district, in order to collect details with regards to their functioning including balance sheet and financials with the ultimate aim of identifying potential improvement areas in the functioning of cooperatives in the country.\\n\\nBasic Eligibility\\n\\nStudents from all academic disciplines may be eligible, although diploma, undergraduate or graduate interns from a social science (sociology/economics) or management background may be preferred\\nTrainees should be residents of that area, which gives them knowledge of the area, knowledge of the local language and their transportation cost is also low.\\nGood understanding of working with computer/mobile and basic knowledge of MS Office/Excel\\nBe able to quickly adopt the prescribed data collection procedures, quality standards of data entry and functioning of cooperatives in the country\\nInterns must be self-motivated and ready to commit to uncovering the potential of the cooperative movement\\nTherefore, It is requested to avail the benefit of this opportunities and share this information with your students and ask them to register on the portal and avail the benefits.\\n\\nWe hope that our internship portal, which is entirely free of cost, will be helpful to you in adapting to a transparent internship process and abundant access to real, credible and the most genuine opportunities.\\n\\nFor any clarifications, feel free to contact us.\\n\\nWith Regards,\\nDr. Buddha Chandrasekhar,\\nChief Coordinating Officer,\\nAICTE HQs, New Delhi\\n011-29581423\\ninternship@aicte-india.org\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: Student and team of Arpit Paliwal\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: Kindly call me\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: There are 8 project reports received till now one is being resent\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: Kindly note that\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: All of you have to write as submitted under my guidance,  Ms. Snehal Moghe\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: Resubmit\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: I've deleted all responses\\n\", \"Snehal Moghe Ma'am Medicaps: Thank you\\n\", 'Your security code with Ayushi Kuare Dayan Medicaps changed.

How can we sustainably provide affordable, accessible nutritious diets for future populations?\\nClean water and sanitation - Tackling water scarcity for future generations. How can clean water – a resource we cannot live without – be provided in a future where it’s more scarce and at higher risk of pollution?\\nGood-health and well-being - The thriving city; centres for physical and mental health and wellbeing. How can we improve city design and infrastructure, by rethinking new technologies and infrastructure and retrofitting existing so that our urban centres become dynamic equitable places for people to live and thrive?\\nThis competition is a fast-paced simulation of a real-world project. Teams are to work collaboratively on a problem to provide a set of deliverables within a short timeframe. Utilising their theoretical knowledge, students gain first-hand experience to develop their critical thinking, build new skill sets, push themselves out of their comfort zone and build lasting relationships.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe details of the event and the registration can be done on https://worldengineeringday.net/hackathon/.
